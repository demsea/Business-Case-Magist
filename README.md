# Project Description

-   **Learning Project Context:**  
    This is a fictional scenario created to practice data analysis and business decision-making skills.
    
-   **About Eniac:**
    
    -   Online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, founded in Spain 10 years ago.
    -   Known for a wide product catalog, competitive pricing, and excellent customer service.
    -   Planning to expand to Brazil, a large and growing eCommerce market, within one year.
-   **The Challenge:**
    
    -   Eniac lacks local partnerships for supply chain, delivery, and customer service in Brazil.
    -   Investor pressure to scale quickly without compromising operational quality.
-   **Potential Partner: Magist:**
    
    -   Brazilian SaaS company offering order management, logistics, and after-sales support.
    -   Provides cost savings and reduced bureaucracy through its established infrastructure.
    -   Eniac is considering a 3-year partnership to test the market while building its own supply chain.
-   **Concerns:**
    
    -   **Product Fit:** Magist may not align with Eniac’s high-end Apple-compatible products.
    -   **Delivery Speed:** Magist’s reliance on the public Post Office may not meet Eniac’s fast delivery standards.
-   **Project Goal:**  
    Analyze Magist’s dataset and the Brazilian market to recommend whether Eniac should sign the deal.  
    The decision should consider:
    
    -   Market trends and growth opportunities.
    -   Magist’s delivery performance.
    -   Alignment with Eniac’s premium brand.

This project focuses on developing analytical and strategic skills through a realistic business scenario.
